## About Me

I am an undergraduate currently studying at the Ohio State University. Being passionate and imaginative in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, I've actively taken part in several competitions and research projects, where my ability of creative thinking and leadership are effectively trained. I've gained experience in designing and programming self-driving systems for USVs and UAVs. I also have experience in multi-modal LLM, multi-agent reinforcement learning, object-centric NeRF and interactive perception as well, which is hopeful to form a full tech stack for human-robot collaborative embodied agents.

*Research Keywords:* Robotics, MARL, Multi-Modal LLM, Object-Centric NeRF.
